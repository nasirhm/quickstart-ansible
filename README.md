## Ansible Quickstart

I'm currently learning Python and came across `ansible` thanks to Google Code in 2019 and Fedora Project.

## What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration

## Files
